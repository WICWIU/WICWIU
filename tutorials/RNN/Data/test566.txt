Very well; and could be content to give him good

First Citizen:
I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be

please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
is, even till the altitude of his virtue.

Second Citizen:
What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
